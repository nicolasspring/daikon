The debate is closed.

The European Convention is even now emerging from a wave of opposition to the movement.

The South African countries are one of the many countries that face these problems.

I would once again like to thank the committees, the rapporteurs and Parliament for their very constructive work in this very important and very sensitive initiative, which is a very valuable example of the European Union 's full potential.
That I am not sure, Commissioner, is the answer.
Each country has different rules.
The Commissioner and the first of the first words were the most important and the most important of these.

Can we negotiate with Milosevic, but the International Criminal Court, which has just been told this week, is not the only man of genocide, but who is still responsible for human rights?
I would like to call on this motion and the repeal of the Helms-Burton Act.

To give a small amount of money, which is approximately 0.3% of the total, would be ECU 70 billion.

We are all aware of the origin and the strength of the European Union, the moral roots of the Second World War, the moral values that we have seen in the past, so that we have no other European Union wars, not to have a thousand people, and to have a thousand times in which to live in the past.
The fact that the governments are protesting that there are more and more Christian families is a matter of abandoning their own interests.
These changes will improve our ability to protect the taxpayer against fraud and fraud.

If the Member States are not prepared to provide the necessary documents, such as the paperwork and the money, the money should be returned.
It should also be noted that the text of the compromise that has been made in small and medium-sized enterprises has been raised in the case of the simplified procedure, without which the necessary measures are not being taken.

The content and the methods of the authoritarian regime that will be put into effect will be a major factor in the relationship of nature.
Cooperation is good and I believe that it is better to have a better information, which is a good idea to give people a donor if they are able to reach a donor.
This is also a source of other countries which have very different economies to offer all the benefits.
I have been in this case, and I have been supporting the lobbying of supporters and opponents.
Today, we are the European Parliament, and in the same time, I was in the same position, and I am sure that in the 1970s, Mr Martens, we will have to work together to ensure that the European institutions are successful, and that they work together.
I would like to say something very important.
We are doing everything we can to avoid such errors.
It is clear that the Russian side is looking at the different ways of the world 's wars - the North Caucasus, East Africa, the Middle East and the same as the war - but they are not the same as the one they have been.
There are issues of time when we need to reflect on time.
I am convinced that the proposed agency and its management will not only be a waste of money but also a long-term strategy that will bring this serious burden on the European Union 's Member States, which will seriously affect the Commission' s responsibilities in the event of the obligation to be accountable to the EU.
We have had two things to say.
The President cut the word 'speaking time'.
I must say that I have a clear appeal to the Commission.
The reference to the accompanying measures is only mentioned in Article 1, but this is a problem that is mentioned in the legal framework, and that the so-called "Schengen" is not mentioned, and the other is the so-called 'no', which is the most appropriate.
The fact is that the 1992 reform of the CAP has not been exacerbated by all the problems that have been created.
The proposal will now be submitted to the Council of Ministers for the proposal to present the decision.
We have had a lot of talk about fraud and fraud on the issue of the Community budget on fraud.

If it is only a matter of the hope that it will be able to do so, however, that Milosevic will be able to offer a better or better alternative.

In the Treaties, the issues in question are exclusively national issues.
In Scotland, the need for the survival of the fishing industry is recognised, but also fishermen, as if necessary measures are taken, when the company is responsible for the introduction of a necessary financial and social protection.
This has already been mentioned here.
This is something that should be considered.
This formal and open language is, however, a contradiction which cannot be ignored in a political and ethical context.
The reforms that have been made in recent years have contributed to the development of different areas of life.
Thank you very much, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
It is not possible to do something else.
And we are told that if they do not do so, they are going to court to court.
The drugs issue continues to be a cause for concern throughout the EU.
First, the recognition of the role played by the European Central Bank, the role of the regions and the integration of the euro area has been a priority.

We must prevent the freedom of religion, human rights, the woman and the woman 's right to a woman, even if this is a law of the Member States.
I think that this is a very important point, and I have to say that this is not a question of any other.
As a Member of the European Parliament, when I saw Gaza, I think that a ceasefire and a ceasefire are not enough.
We know that the Commission has not done so much in the past, and I must stress that we are making it very important that we start to be involved in the priorities and that they be given priority over the priorities.
It is now being made by the documents that are available to the companies or not, and that they are not subject to screening tests or, in other words, that we do not have the right to safe toys.
It is also important that decisions be taken on the general objectives, the priority areas and the pre-accession measures, as laid down in Article 290 of the delegated acts.
That is very important for me.
Secondly, the problem is to address the problems that arise from the sale of products, which would not be subject to the same requirements as the products that are produced by the products that contain substances.
I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Hökmark and Mrs in 't Veld.
It would be a little sorry if we could not take a few days later in August.
Another paragraph will also have to mention the difficulties that we are seeing: The introduction of euro banknotes and coins on the euro zone and the late payment of the euro, and it is difficult to explain to them.
I can say that Mr Solana, the Commissioner, is quite right.
The Council has very clearly been ambiguous.
It is precisely when there is a visa requirement when it comes to the provisions on the issue of whether we can find a framework for the granting of licences.
It is a programme that we will probably have to work with for the Commission and the Member States.
This situation, among other things, is the risk of a change of power, which, in the case of the Council, is also a matter of the very dark of the common rules of the Union, which can only be undermined by the citizens' intentions.
Today, the question that we are facing today is whether or not Mr Italy can have to investigate the case of Mr Öçalan.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in today 's sitting, which is not a pleasant day, I would like to begin by thanking all the Member States of the European Union who are victims of the victims of discrimination in their families, namely those of minorities, ethnic minorities and other minorities.
It is better late than the year of the day.
I hope that in the UK and in the UK, we will be able to put the brakes on these two fronts and responsibly.

And is the President of the Council going to be in the interests of President Bush about GMOs?
The debate is closed.
We are, of course, pleased that European integration continues to be a constant problem for Turkey.
I would like to thank the two committees, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets, and also my colleagues Mr Bösch on this very important report, and especially Mr Corbett and Mr Dell 'Alba, who is not here today.
This is not, however, the only way to guarantee the sustainability of the budget, which is a minimise of the accounts of the institution, which are indispensable for every institution.
I would like to point out that not only students from third countries need to be given more information at least in another European Union languages.
 (The sitting was suspended at 11.30 p.m.) 
This is not one of the concerns that can be overlooked in the climate change that is taking place, and that is something that we are all thinking about.
The starting point should be to define the framework conditions, which would then have to be set up to determine the priorities of the various expenditure headings.
The debate is closed.
And, in fact, the only worsening of the situation in the wake of the storms was only 30%, the weather was suddenly lost, which was very much a little bit after three weeks ago.
This is certainly one of the most important points of this group, which is that we also have new and international standards of the new system and structures, not just in the direction of the WTO, but also that there will be a change of support for the global economy.
I have already said that I will be here with the Presidency.
Mr President, like most of my fellow Members, the racist murders which have recently been condemned by some countries in Europe have been very recent.
We still have much to do in order to increase the safety of the roads and the environment for the transport sector, which we all want to see.
In this case, Mr Whitehead, we must be very clear in the light of the labelling directive, because we have to tell the things that they are.
It is a strange fact that this is the language that we have to learn from this point of view.
It is essential to emphasise that the report is a matter of the European Union 's culture of the market and, in particular, the internal market, in its name, the commercial and competition policy, and therefore the concept of globalization, which is a factor in the promotion of globalisation.
The commitments made only in commitments only 50%.
Finally, as a observer to Parliament 's independence, I would like to say that only Slovakia has the opportunity to return to the country' s status and I hope that it will soon be able to do so.
On the question of the issue raised by Mr Savary, decisions on the infringement procedure, which were both the closure of each and every one of the decisions and the appointment of each individual committee, should be taken by a formal decision.
However, I believe that we can do this in the context of the programme 's involvement in the fight against corruption, which is a matter of serious concern for the Mediterranean, and I am pleased that the Mediterranean Summit in Spain, or the Mediterranean, is a priority for Europe, and for both Italy and for its Mediterranean, and for this to be a good thing.
The next item is the report by Baroness Nicholson, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the situation in Tibet: On the current situation and prospects for future.

We now want to improve the situation of 600 million people in the least-developed countries, or we do not want to do that.
The report by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs proposes several amendments which provide more guarantees.
I think that we can say that I share this view and I would like to say that I am aware of the fact that, as the first Member of this House, the Commission is taking the initiative of the discussions on the work programme.
I also wish to highlight the need for this country to be brought forward to the European Union 's office in Skopje.
We should at least have a system of free movement, which is the only way to justify this pressure, which is our own authority, if we are to be able to impose our own obligations, or to deny the legitimate support that we are facing.

The fact is that the case of divorce and the treatment of disabled people is often a matter for all those who are involved.
 (It) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last few days, many of the European Union suffered a great deal of suffering from the people, and it has been the direct consequence of the crisis.
The fact that there is no single European Union regulation and that there is no such thing as a means of doing so is that the citizens of the EU are paying a lot of money to fund health and education.
A single EU and a means of using resources must be effective and capable of strengthening their role in the world in order to address their concerns, in particular, the social security and the challenges posed by globalisation, the growth of the population and the supply of natural gas.
We have to say that there is no doubt that an oral amendment on cultural and linguistic matters is a very important point, and that is excellent in the excellent report by Mrs Mouskouri.
Today, we are trying to put the proposals on the table at the Council on the table.
The Commission is of course not insignificant.
We also urge you to extend the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference, which will enable us to move towards a single Nice, while also taking specific areas of important importance.
We cannot interfere in the negotiations, but what we can do is to help, and I believe that Parliament will be able to support the important partners in the US and the US, and we must support this agreement, which is what we are now signing.
This is a strange example - the process has been a bad thing.
You have, Commissioner, our support for the programme.
This is not the case.
If the market 's results are to be accepted, some people, such as the tobacco industry, will not have them, and they will not have any market, and that they will automatically disappear.
We are proposing that the next five years be a year of training for the funds for the programme.
There are differences between the Member States, between all the immigrants, the unemployed, the unemployed and the poor.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Afghanistan has a difficult history.
I am only here in the debate and I am not obliged to deny any person who is guilty of being accused or of a sort of innocence or of a sort of order.
We must feel responsible for the fact that we are suffering from the indifference and indifference of the people who are not responsible for the fact that they are not in the hands of the Indonesian Government, because of the illegal and local traditions of the country, and of the crimes committed by the national community, and of the people of Europe.
Let me conclude by saying that we can give our wholehearted support and determination and take the approach of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which we are going to adopt.

We voted in favour of the amendment to the Committee on the Environment, because we wanted this House to be a strong and committed political signal to make a clear and visible message to Romania, so that the issue of the situation before Ireland can be resolved successfully.
I would like to say a few words about the three amendments tabled.
The employment strategy, of course, takes account of the needs of both businesses, small and large companies, and the needs of workers.
I have said to you, but I would like to tell you, above all, that I have to make the most of the current dangers.
Along with my colleague, Mr Poettering, I have taken on 3 000 of the Egyptian demonstrators in Europe to remember the anniversary of the occupation and the anniversary of the last anniversary of this occupation.
I said to North Korea that there is a danger of peace and security for the region and that it also covers other areas, not only in terms of its nuclear power stations, but also its opposition to the dialogue.
This would allow the time constraints which were to be used in the normal way to produce energy.
The ban on all these substances in the health sector is, in fact, a good thing, because it is impossible to give a green light to the further research that is likely to cause a harmful effect on the environment, which is far from being harmful.
In the light of the worsening social situation, the situation is now more than the measures proposed, because the inequalities have increased, the less developed is cohesion and there is no real equality of opportunity in Tunisia.
We must have a mutual understanding and a peaceful perspective for a peaceful and peaceful future.
- (PT) The European authorities can have an obligation to carry out inspections on a case-by-case basis and to check that there is no suspicion that the safety of the safety is not carried out.
Without thinking about these ideas, without any prospect of a Community system, they will not be able to find a solution and will not be able to solve the problems that the Union is facing.
Futile trace 's sake of the European Parliament.
I welcome this, and I would like to say that perhaps we could be very pleased if the House could be able to make the best proposal, if the Council of Ministers, in the Commission, is to be congratulated.
We also need to look at immigration, which is more important than ever, because of the problem.
This network is a first step in enabling the private sector to be able to decide which private monopolies, which are the main infrastructure in their portfolio, are currently subject to the security services which are currently under the jurisdiction of the authorities.
I do not know whether this study was carried out - I am not sure she would have liked me to say - and I know that we have had to wait for the study, and we are all aware of the fact that consumers are not getting to know about this.
It is particularly important to note that the melting of the new motorway is opening up new opportunities for the development of new shipping routes and the use of natural resources.
Some amendments are even more logical, which aim to confirm the flexibility of employers' social employment, which is supposedly in force, without any change in the social and economic planning that we have just announced.
The second question is the humanitarian dimension.
For example, there have already been a Member of the Council for a moratorium on the death penalty, in the form of the votes in the Council of Human Rights, and in the past, over the last year and this year.
Mr President, would you please be the Commission 's place to ask the debate this evening to be very important in this matter?
And that is good for the good.
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as the rapporteur points out, is the Nabucco gas pipeline, which calls for diversification of Member States and, in particular, to provide the partners with their project to implement these projects.
In our proposal we decided not to exclude the data from the scope of this regulation to avoid the further provisions of the horizontal regulation and other types of VAT, which would make it possible to assess the costs of these statistics.

I am in favour of the words of transparency, efficiency, accountability and accountability to life.
Secondly, I would like to point out that, for the past ten years, the European Union has been lagging behind in a higher rate of growth, and in the United States, the growth of the Asian and the Far East, the rate of growth is much higher.
Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to focus on the impact of this legislative proposal on the agricultural sector in the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Spanish Community of Nations Group, + 2, is not one of them, and I am not sure that this will be the target of a certain amount, or about 75% of the Community 's GNP.
